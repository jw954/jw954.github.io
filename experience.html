        <h3>Computer Vision Research Intern — <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/" target="_blank">Toronto Computational Imaging Group</a></h3>
        <p class="meta">Aug 2025 – Present · Toronto, ON, Canada</p>
        <p>Working on undergraduate thesis focused on generating color images/videos/bursts from binary quanta frames using single-photon imaging at <b>100,000 fps</b>. Utilizing real data captures from single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) and examining distribution of generations and performance in low-light conditions where conventional CMOS cameras fail. Calibrating SPAD dataset to implement a non-parametric single photon simulation pipeline from standard RGB datasets. Performing downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection solely from one-bit images based generations.</p>

        <h3>Computer Vision Research Intern — <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io" target="_blank">Safe AI Lab</a>, Carnegie Mellon University</h3>
        <p class="meta">Aug 2024 – Present · Pittsburgh, PA, USA · Supervisor: Prof. Ding Zhao</p>
        <p>Co-first author of <i>FeatureEndo-4DGS: Real-Time Deformable Surgical Scene Reconstruction and Segmentation with 4D Gaussian Splatting</i> (ML4H Symposium 2025, PMLR). Innovated the <b>first real-time</b> 4D Gaussian Splatting pipeline that jointly reconstructs and segments deformable surgical scenes via feature distillation from 2D foundation models. Leveraged foundation models for semantic scene understanding and outperformed SOTA methods (LGS, EndoGaussian, EndoNeRF) on PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and RMSE. Achieved competitive segmentation vs. SAM/SAM2/MedSAM with higher Dice and IoU. Ablations showed a lightweight semantic feature decoder boosts segmentation scores by up to <b>10%</b>. Worked with CUDA and C++ to adapt parallelized rasterizers for training and rendering. Explored autoregressive large models with diffusion-loss prediction of Gaussians and camera properties for rigid objects.</p>
